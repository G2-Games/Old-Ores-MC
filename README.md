# Old Ores

**This texture pack is also available for download from [Curseforge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/old-ores-copper/)**. The bedrock version is not available from there.

## What is this pack for?
The changes it makes to the game are:
- Reverts all ore textures to pre-1.17
- Reverts deepslate variants
- Changes copper to a custom texture that I think fits with the old ores
